The code has been refracted so the application works as follows: 
The user is greeted with a generate password button. Once pressed the user is prompted through a series of options to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters , numbers and symbols in their password.
Once that is done the user is asked to confirm the number of characters required for the password with anything less than 8 or more than 128 giving an out of range message. 

Once the password is generated it appears in the text area within the webapp.
